### CPSC 120

* Lab 3 

    Lab 3, Part 1 is one of my favorites because it was something that I can see myself using. In this lab, I learned that I can use double to use the Mifflin-St Jeor equation to help calculate the BMR of a man and woman. Calculating my BMR by inputting weight, height, and age without the need to do all the calculations makes it very simple for me. 

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, Part 2 is another one of my favorites because it reminds me of the guessing game my friends and I play when we are trying to decide on something. The person who guesses the secret number or is closest wins the game. In this lab, I learned that we can use a series of std::cin and std::cout to create a guessing game along with a loop to tell the user if they are guessing too low or too high. 

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, Part 1 is another favorite because it would get the average of all the judges scores which would make everything fair. Eliminating the lowest and highest score would prevent a biased judge and won't affect the final score. In this lab, I learned more about declaring a variable named scores using the type vector and if/for loops to calculate the scores.
