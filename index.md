### CPSC 120

* Lab 3 

    Lab 3, Part 1 is one of my favorites because it was something that I can see myself using. Being able to calculate my BMR by inputting weight, height, and age without the need of doing all the calculations makes it very simple for me.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, Part 2 is another one of my favorites because it reminds me of that guessing game that my friends and I play when we are trying to decide on something. The person who guesses the secret number or closest to the secret number wins.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, Part 1 is another favorite because it would get the average of all the judges scores which would make everything fair. Being able to eliminate the lowest and highest score would prevent a biased judge and won't affect the final score.
